Should use ColorChecker or similar instead of Schmid chart
Should use RAW. This should totally eliminate dependency on camera white balance setting
Filter spectra should be non-overlapping
Should analyze dataset of reflectance (SPD) spectra to determine most critical wavelengths
Should investigate focal length/f-number/filter size relation. Try to shrink lens aperture
Should be smarter about giving more weight to color channels where sensitivity is higher (to maximize SNR)
Should place CWRs at sensitivity peaks

==========================

How to implement "sparse mode"?
	1. Determine if sparse mode is necessary when filters are selected
	2. If so, determine the "sparse" domain, i.e. the CWLs for the filters
	3. For DC calculation, compute for "sparse" domain, then interpolate/extrapolate to standard domain

==========================

What are the qualities of an ideal filter set?
	Equal CWL spacing
	Limits correspond to same camera sensitivity
	All stations are round numbers
	All stations are commercially available

	There is no point in sampling much finer than 43 nm
		Given constraints of commercial availability, this means 40 nm is the "right" spacing (30 too fine, 50 too coarse)
	There is no point in sampling insensitive regions around 400 and 700 nm
