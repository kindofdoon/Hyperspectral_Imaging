% function explore_munsell_characteristic_spectra

    % The purpose of this function is to explore the characteristic reflectance
    % spectra for the set of 1,257 Munsell color chips, as documented in
    % "Characteristic spectra of Munsell colors", Parkkinen, Hallikainen,
    % and Jaaskelainen, published 1989.
    
    % Specifically, I want to see how well these characteristic spectra can
    % be reconstructed using various interpolation methods from sparse
    % samples.
