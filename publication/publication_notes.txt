What are the key ideas?
	The idea that SPDs are about 7-dimensional
	Measuring camera sensitivity
	Producing SPD estimates from sensor data

What aspects are relevant in the title?
	Low-cost
	DSLR
	7 laser line filters
	Off-the-shelf components
	
Low-Cost Laser-Line DSLR Hyperspectral Imaging

What is the sequence?
	Realize that SPDs are of low dimensionality
	Determine filter set
	Measure camera sensitivity using filters
	Measure SPDs using above

Cost
	Camera 		275
	Spectro 1 	300
	Filters 	700
